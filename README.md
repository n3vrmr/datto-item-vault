# Datto Item Vault
Welcome to the **DIV**, or Datto Item Vault, where all items deleted in Vault Cleanings go.

## Work in Progress
There have been many vault cleanings, and they are all recorded in extremely long videos. It also takes a lot of time to manually input all of the data into the spreadsheet. If you're reading this, that means the data available will be updated as soon as I am able to do it.

## Regarding the data
I am trying to collect as much information as possible on all deleted items, which sometimes means information that is not shown in the videos, such as the first two perks of a weapon roll, or a weapon's masterwork (when it is not masterworked). That means the data will be, in many parts, incomplete. However, I stil think there can be some useful insights by recording all of this in a dataset for future analysis.

## Regarding the analysis
My analysis will only begin once I finish the dataset, which will take a long time, as I mentioned above. Nonetheless, if you want to use the partial data for your own analysis, feel free to do so! I encourage anyone willing to use this dataset. If you find any errors, you can contact me through my email to let me know.
